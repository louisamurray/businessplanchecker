Designing a program to check the quality of a business plan could involve the following steps:

- Define Quality Metrics: Determine the key metrics that the program will use to assess the quality of the business plan, such as completeness, clarity, viability, and feasibility.

- Develop a Scoring System: Create a scoring system that assigns a numerical score to each metric, based on the level of quality achieved. The scoring system should be objective and consistent.

- Create Evaluation Criteria: Develop specific criteria for evaluating each metric, such as the presence of key sections in the business plan, the use of clear and concise language, the validity of financial projections, and the alignment of the plan with the business's mission and goals.

- Identify Reviewers: Select a team of experienced reviewers who have expertise in business planning and can provide unbiased evaluations of the plans.

- Train Reviewers: Provide training to the reviewers on the quality metrics, scoring system, and evaluation criteria, to ensure that they can accurately and consistently evaluate the plans.

- Implement the Program: Use the program to evaluate business plans submitted for review, and provide feedback to the plan authors on areas where improvements can be made.

- Monitor and Improve the Program: Regularly review and update the quality metrics, scoring system, and evaluation criteria to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in assessing the quality of business plans. Also, monitor the program's performance and identify areas for improvement.

In summary, designing a program to check the quality of a business plan requires defining quality metrics, developing a scoring system, creating evaluation criteria, identifying reviewers, training them, implementing the program, and monitoring and improving the program over time.
